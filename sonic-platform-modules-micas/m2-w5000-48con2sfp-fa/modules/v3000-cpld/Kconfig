	  This driver provides access to CPLD devices on AMD-based platforms
	  via eSPI Peripheral Channel. It supports two CPLD chips (CPU CPLD
	  and CTRL CPLD) selected via GPIO-controlled chip select lines.

	  The driver creates character device interfaces:
	    /dev/cpld_cpu    - Binary register access
	    /dev/cpld_ctrl   - Binary register access

	  Userspace can use dd/pread/pwrite to access CPLD registers at
	  arbitrary offsets for platform management and control.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called wb-cpld.

	  If unsure, say N.
